# Reflective Essay Group 4

###Project Context 
The final outcome of our Advanced Software Engineering project was to produce a cross platform application that displayed 
house price data in the form of a heatMap within a radius relative to the current location of a user.The project was undertaken 
by six (6) students within a period of four (4) months. The nature of this project as with every other software product 
started off with a high-level overview of the software's expectation, and also with the accommodation for feature modifications 
as hinted by the client. As the project progressed the client, regular meetings in form of of the various iterations of 
the software being developed was demoed to the user and feedback for modification were collected and and improved on, with
 each set of requirements increasing in complexity.


###Positive Outcomes
Peer programming...


Throughout the duration of the project, ever member of the group were working remotely, as each person had their own machines
and predominantly worked from home. As a team it never caused an issue as we were able to maintain communication between
all members on a daily basis through our instant messaging application of choice: Slack. It enabled for there to be
clear communication so no one felt isolated from the project. As a team we ensured that meeting timings
were negotiated and communicated clearly through the chat, with a majority of meetings being held over a video messaging
application called 'Zoom'. Slack also allowed us to get instant feedback on any issues or questions we have had about various 
elements of the project. The application allowed us to link the external application e.g. GitHub, Travis CI and Hooks etc.
A separate channel was created where the team was notified about new pull requests or the status of build tests, these notifications
were set up to automatically trigger.  

Code reviews were implemented in a fairly ad hoc manor however they proved to work effectively. The team implemented a 
system where any changes to the GitHub had to be reviewed by at least one member of the team before it was committed to
master. No individual person was in charge performing the review, so it gave an opportunity for any member of the team
to do so. This was very effective as it allowed for the reviewer to pass any comments or improvements they left necessary, 
and if any changes were needed it was the responsibility of the original author to do so. 

###Negative Outcomes
One of the main issues we had as a group were the meetings that we had. A lot of them were done using a online
tool called Zoom, which allowed us to video call as a group. This seemed like a good idea as it allowed actions like
screen share allowing us to demonstrate solutions to the rest of te group. However, the main issue was that people had 
different hardware and internet speeds, meaning we spent a lot of time configuring hardware. Zoom was also prone to a
latency issues meaning we needed a constant fast internet speed as mentioned. Meaning there were a lot of times
when multiple people were talking above each other. Overall, this was a good tool when it came to potentially
demonstrating code etc. however it did cause a lot of inefficiencies as a lot of time was wasted when
communicating and meeting timings were not used efficiently.


###Future Work
In the future we need to re-think the way meetings are conducted. From our experience potentially setting up physical 
meetings (with any remote members being on a video call) would be best for our team as it would increase the efficiency 
of our meetings, but we do know that this could be difficult as people have different schedules so regular meetings can
be hard. Additionally, zoom could still be used, but we could use it in smaller calls e.g. two or three people
still allowing for frequent meetings without having large number of people talking over each other.
