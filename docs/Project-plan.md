The table of contents for the project plan is:

* [Organisation plan](#organisation-plan)
* [Conflict resolution plan](#conflict-resolution-plan)
* [Peer assessment plan](#peer-assessment-plan)

## Organisation Plan

Based on the requirements of the module, we decided that we are a [Product Team](https://martinfowler.com/articles/products-over-projects.html). A Product Team has a few attributes that differentiate itself from a Project Team:
* We are funded as a team. The currency we use is time, we have a budget of _n_ days that is available until the end of the module.
* We are funded for building, running and maintaining the software system.
* We will last as a team as long as we have business relevance, in our case until the final deadline.
* Our roadmap is built and prioritized by the Product Owner in collaboration with their business counterparts.
* We define success as a direct improvement of a business metric, ideally against well defined KPIs.

### Team Structure and Organisation

As a team, we decided to share the roles based on our competencies and interests in learning new things. When we met for the first time, we realized that we have a mix of skills and a mix of learning outcomes from this project. In going forward, we decided to organise ourselves as a hybrid team, where we have people with a mix of skills, from business analysis, to development, testing and operations.

As an Agile framework we decided to go ahead with Kanban due to several reasons:
* Previous experience for team members.
* The need to iterate fast and deliver value continuously.
* The fact that we are a small team and we don't require many processes and ceremonies to organise ourselves.
* Empower the team to take the decisions required for delivering the product.

We considered in using other Agile frameworks, like Scrum and XP. Unfortunatelly they were not considered due to several reasons:
* It delivers value in pre-defined cycles, usually every two weeks. We want to deliver continuous value, releasing very often, presenting to the client, getting feedback and iterating on the feedback.
* Scrum has a few ceremonies focused more on project management, like estimation and daily standup that we are willing to apply because we work a lot remotely and we do not work against story points. We work against stories.
* XP is focusing a lot on pair programming and we cannot achieve that, as we are mostly a distributed team, that works in their own time to deliver value. Our work pattern is 24h/day, not the regular 9-5.
