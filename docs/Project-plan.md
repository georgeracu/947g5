## Organisation Plan

Based on the requirements of the module, we decided that we are a [Product Team](https://martinfowler.com/articles/products-over-projects.html). A Product Team has a few attributes that differentiate itself from a Project Team:

- We are funded as a team - for building, running and maintaining the product. The currency we use is time, we have a budget of _n_ days that is available until the end of the module.
- We will last as a team as long as we have business relevance, in our case until the final deadline.
- Our roadmap is built and prioritized by the Product Owner in collaboration with their business counterparts.
- We define success as a direct improvement of a business metric, ideally against well defined KPIs.

### Team Structure and Organisation

As a team, we decided to share the roles based on our competencies and interests in learning new things. When we met for the first time, we realized that we have a mix of skills and a mix of learning outcomes from this project. In going forward, we decided to organise ourselves as a hybrid team, where we have people with a mix of skills, from business analysis, to development, testing and operations.

As an Agile framework we decided to go ahead with Kanban due to several reasons:

- Previous experience from team members.
- The need to iterate fast and deliver value continuously.
- The fact that we are a small team and we don't require many processes and ceremonies in development.
- Empower the team to take the decisions required for delivering the product.
- The ability to visualise the work in progress of the team which Kanban supports via the use of cards on the board.
- Kanban allows for work to be initiated by a request from the client.

We considered in using other Agile frameworks, like Scrum and XP. they were not considered due to several reasons:

- It delivers value in pre-defined cycles, usually every two weeks. We want to deliver continuous value, releasing very often, presenting to the client, getting feedback and iterating on the feedback.
- Scrum has a few ceremonies focused more on project management, like estimation and daily standup that we are willing to apply because we work a lot remotely and we do not work against story points. We work against stories.
- XP is focusing a lot on pair programming and we cannot achieve that, as we are mostly a distributed team, that works in their own time to deliver value. Our work pattern is 24h/day, not the regular 9-5.

#### Team Members

- Iben, Labaran Rogers
- Racu, Ion-Georgica
- Carter, Benjamin

## Conflict Resolution Plan

Considering the small size of the team and the likelihood that we will be required to produce deliverables to the customer on a regular basis with a minimum buffer to extend deadlines, we have chosen to adopt a style that encourages compromise amongst team members. The aim is to maintain a good working relationship between all members during the entire duration of the project.

### Maintaining project flow

It is highly likely that the project will be disrupted by unforeseen events, with the most probable scenarios being illness and missed deadlines. All disruptive scenarios will be dealt with on a per-case basis, but as a general rule-of-thumb, we suggest:

- Making a list of jobs the member was working on.
- Re-distributing the cards amongst group members based on their available capacity.
- Reflecting on the groups roadmap.
  - Making sure that all future deadlines will be met.
  - If necessary, meeting with the client to explain why a deadline was not met.
  - Resolve conflicts in scheduling.
  - Openly discuss within the group any difficulties in the work.
    - This is expected - we have a range of technical abilities, it is essential we support each other.
- Facilitating the member back into the workflow, to encourage contribution and maximise productivity.

In the event that people do not agree on the score they get in the peer assessment, members will be allowed to defend their case and suggest why their score should be changed. As per the Peer Assessment Plan, all members have agreed to an open discussion on the individual contribution to the project, and what metrics will be used to defend the distribution of points.

## Peer Assessment Plan

The project will encompass a range of technological and business-oriented ability. The client has suggested some metrics to score group contributions - from which, we have decided to evaluate individual project performances on:

- Quality of work
- Overall level of participation
- Suggesting ideas
- Extracting something useful from the ideas
- Performing routine tasks
- Sorting out problems
- Initiative
  - Generating ideas for activities and methods of solution
  - Finding ideas from other sources
- Commitment
  - Doing a fair share of the work
  - Meeting deadlines
  - Attending meetings (virtual or otherwise)
- Conductive group behaviour
  - Allowing other members to have a fair chance to contribute
  - Responding constructively to each other's contributions

Our team structure notes we are a 24/7, distributed team. Conventional methods of tracking contribution, such as logging hours or lines of code, would not be suitable due to the bias it would put on more learned members. Instead, we will use adaptive evaluation, making sure that different levels of technical, analytical and business ability are accounted for when compiling our peer assessment.

Once the project is complete, each member of the team will put forward what they believe their contribution is worth, on a point system of 1-100. This likens to the payout for the project - 100 points is 100% of the project salary. If there is disagreement on the cost of an individuals contribution, or if the net point total is not equal to 100, then the group will discuss increasing or decreasing their own, or other members' score.

The Peer Assessment is a vital stage to the project. If not unanimously agreed on, then the group will lose 25 points. This document will be published after unanimous agreement from all group members.
